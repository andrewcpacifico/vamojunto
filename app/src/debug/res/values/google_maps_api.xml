    TODO: Before you run your application, you need a Google Maps API key.

    To get one, follow this link, follow the directions and press "Create" at the end:

https://console.developers.google.com/flows/enableapi?apiid=maps_android_backend&keyType=CLIENT_SIDE_ANDROID&r=1D:30:5F:5F:51:CB:33:4D:6C:89:09:89:24:1F:83:87:FB:93:B5:8C%3Bco.vamojunto

    You can also add your credentials to an existing key, using this line:
    1D:30:5F:5F:51:CB:33:4D:6C:89:09:89:24:1F:83:87:FB:93:B5:8C;co.vamojunto

    Once you have your key (it starts with "AIza"), replace the "google_maps_key"
    string in this file.
